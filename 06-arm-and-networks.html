        <h1>Typical shot selection: From Zion’s floater to Dame’s logo shot</h1>

        <p><span>Rui Qiu</span></p>
        <p><span>Updated on 2021-10-19.</span></p>
        <br>

        <p><span>It’s a pity that the shot attempt data from chapter 3 hasn’t been utilized since then. Luckily,
                this won’t be the case anymore. This chapter aims to perform </span><em><span>associate rule
                    mining</span></em><span> (ARM) on a portion of NBA shot data. An explanation will be given later
                on why only partial data is used here.</span></p>
        <p><span>The ARM will identify a list of </span><strong><span>controlled</span></strong><span> frequent
                itemsets, thus leading to a list of </span><strong><span>controlled</span></strong><span> frequent
                rules. They are controlled because only rules contain the information of if this specific shot is
                made matter. Otherwise, rules such as </span><code>{shottype=Arc3=&gt;value=3}</code><span> will be
                valid for sure but not informative.</span></p>
        <p><span>Although the shot data won’t provide any highlights of a player’s signature move, it will hopefully
                give some insights into his favorite shot selection. To some extent, this also draws the boundary of
                a player’s </span><em><span>hot zone</span></em><span>.</span></p>

            <h2><span>Data cleaning</span></h2>

            <p><span>The data cleaning procedure starts by loading a previously cleaned, tidy data set. Since the ARM
                    has a specific requirement for categorical variables as the input, variables will be factorized
                    accordingly.</span></p>
            <p><span>In short, we are doing the following three types of data mutation:</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Transform numeric data to factors</span></li>
                <li><span>Transform logical data to factors with details</span></li>
                <li><span>Transform NA to data as well.</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p><span>Unsurprisingly, since the data preserved lots of NAs in some variables for the integrity of the
                    data, it is relatively reasonable to discard them in this task. Are they providing some information?
                    Yes. But are they providing enough information to be included in the rule? Not really. A trial run
                    with NAs gives out many rules with uninterpretable items. Therefore, the following variables are
                    considered to be the participants of rules:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>player</code><span>: the name of the shot taker.</span></li>
                <li><code>period</code><span>: the time period of a game that the shot takes place.</span></li>
                <li><code>shottype</code><span>: the specific type of the shot, e.g., </span><code>Arc3</code><span>,
                    </span><code>Corner3</code><span>, etc.</span></li>
                <li><code>value</code><span>: either 2 pts or 3 pts.</span></li>
                <li><code>and1</code><span>: whether the shot is fouled, and a free throw is given.</span></li>
                <li><code>made</code><span>: whether the shot is made and corresponding pts are rewarded.</span></li>

            <p><span>After that, the data frame will again be processed by the generic R function

            <p><span>Apriori algorithm is an easy-to-implement and interpretable algorithm frequently used in ARM. It
                    prunes all
                    the combinations of itemsets by setting a few parameters.</span></p>
            <p><span>The parameters used for the generation of these rules are:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>support = 0.0001</code></li>
                <li><code>confidence = 0.5</code></li>
                <li><code>minlen = 6</code></li>
                <li><span>And the RHS of the rule must be either </span><code>made=is_made</code><span> or
                    </span><code>made=not_made</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>These parameters generate hundreds of meaningful rules, which are listed in that embedded
                    spreadsheet.</span></p>
            <p><span>As mentioned above, although the complete set of rules should be more than what is presented here,
                    many of
                    them are meaningless, considering the goal of analyzing this dataset is to outline players’ typical
                    shot
                    selection. Therefore, the parameters are set to be:</span></p>

                    accessible in
                    the repository. At the same, they are uploaded to an Airtable spreadsheet as well. You can observe

            <h3><span>Top rules</span></h3>
            <p><span>Then, the rules are sorted by three metrics separately. For each metric, the top 15 results will be

                        itemsets since </span><em><span>support</span></em><span> indicates how frequently the items

            <ul>

                        indicates that the two events (LHS and RHS) are dependent on one another. It shows that some

                    </span><em><span>signature</span></em><span> shot selections are identified. All of the 15 typical
                        shot
                        selection combinations are 2-pointers. The top three are Zion and Giannis’ shots with and-1. How

            <h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>

            <p><span>To conclude, ARM is a basic rule-based machine learning method used to identify interesting
                    relations
                    between variables in a rather large dataset. The threshold used to define what a
                </span><strong><span>“strong”</span></strong><span> rule is, however, can be tuned by manual selection.
                    Based on
                    this method, a list of meaningful rules about NBA players and their shot selections are
                    generated.</span>

            <p><span>The network visualization is a perfect choice to demonstrate the interconnection among different
                    rules and
                    rules’ items. Too many rules can, of course, be visualized within one html widget, but it won’t be
                    easy to
                    be interact with. For the following three visualization packages, each only visualizes a partition
                    of the rules data for the apparent aesthetic

            <p><span>Although the rules are ranked by </span><strong><span>support</span></strong><span>, the visual
                    cues focus
                    on the other two metrics. The associate rules are marked as red circles in the network. The darker
                    the
                    circle, the higher </span><strong><span>confidence</span></strong><span> it indicates. The larger,
                    the
                    higher </span><strong><span>lift</span></strong><span> it has. The ones in the corner, for example,
                    are the
                    rules of Zion Williamson and Giannis Antetokounmpos’ shot at the rim. There are also some nodes with
                    high
                    degrees, which means they are pretty </span><strong><span>common</span></strong><span> in many
                    rules. The
                    nodes with </span><code>made=is_made</code><span> and </span><code>made=not_made</code><span> are
                    automatically two with high traffic since any rule connects with either of them. Some other nodes,
                    which are
                    the variables used to describe a shot, are also connected by a large number of edges.</span></p>

            <h3><span>Data preparation</span></h3>

            <p><span>With the rule dataset and some basic knowledge of graph theory, we can transform the dataset into
                    something
                    more D3-friendly. Roughly speaking, the new datasets should contain

                    including
                    some miscellaneous aspects like the group and the color of those elements.</span></p>
            <p><span>Unlike the sub-dataset used by </span><code>{arulesViz}</code><span>, the one visualized by the
                    following two
                    packages uses the complete ruleset. Then we extract two subsets from the data,</span></p>

                <li><span>one containing top 50 made shots scenario in the 4th quarter ranked by counts, </span></li>

            <p><span>The network visualized above shows some common shot selections in the 4th quarter of an NBA game,
                    a.k.a,
                    “the clutch time.” The orange nodes are the associate rules, while the blue ones are shot variables
                    (including the </span><code>player</code><span>). The most common two variables are automatically
                </span><code>made=is_made</code><span> and </span><code>period=4</code><span>, since all rules are
                    apparently
                    about these two. Then there are </span><code>shottype=AtRim</code><span> and
                </span><code>shottype=ShortMidRange</code><span>. This might be explained by many tactics built on “safe
                    plays.”
                    Another cause might be filtering by counts, such that many risky but successful 3-pointer made are
                    excluded
                    due to small quantity.</span></p>

            <h2><span>Summary</span></h2>
            <p><span>In summary, the data scraped and cleaned from the last few weeks are finally put into action. By
                    using ARM,
                    one can quickly unearth the typical shot selection patterns among NBA players. With some proper data
                    manipulation, even more, information is revealed with the assistance of network
                    visualization.</span></p>
            <p><span>For the development of modern basketball, splitting the data season by season will clearly
                    highlight the
                    changes in shot selections of a player, a team, or the whole league, which is an indicator of
                    tactical
                    changes. More importantly, ARM and networks can be utilized when dealing with tons of data. Imagine
                    a
                    scenario that an analyst needs to study the shot preferences of an opponent team. Therefore, they
                    can
                    extract the frequent rules in a flash instead of watching hundreds of hours of videotapes.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span>Admittedly, the dataset used in this chapter is barely a fraction of the entire shot scenario, as
                    lots of
                    other descriptive variables are removed for various reasons. If more data is provided, it’s
                    definitely
                    possible to build a more captivating list of basketball “rules” so that both analysts and ordinary
                    audiences
                    can read the game from another angle. Furthermore, a predictive model based on associate rule mining
                    is
                    practical to predict how threatening a shot could be. Thus, it could serve as one piece of the xT
                    model we
                    initially aim to build from the beginning.</span>
