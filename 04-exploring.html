        <p><span>There are so many aspects to cover when it comes to exploratory data analysis. Some might give the
                analyst an unseen new perspective, and some might need their prior knowledge before plotting.</span></p>

        <section id="location">
            <h2><span>Location-based shot attempts</span></h2>
            <p><span>Back to the very core of the model to build, it is vital to show shot attempts whether it is a
                    success
                    or
                    failure.</span></p>

                <figcaption>Shot attempts coordinates of all 30 teams.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <blockquote>
                <p><span>To keep the plot visually pleasing, the area restricted by the coordinates is made close to a
                        square.
                        Some records are backcourt &quot;yeets,&quot; which usually happen when a quarter runs out and
                        the
                        offensive
                        team does not have enough time to organize an attack. In this case, the ball-controlling player
                        will
                        desperately throw the ball as hard as towards the rim to try his luck. Thus some of the data are
                        discarded
                        as a result.</span></p>

        <section id="was">
            <h3><span>Washington Wizards&#39; shooting locations</span></h3>
            <p><span>As the data are split by teams, it is very handy to load and plot a team&#39;s performance in a
                    season.
                    Let&#39;s take Washington Wizards as an example.</span></p>

        </section>

        <section id="time">
            <h2><span>Time-based shot attempts</span></h2>
            <p><span>Another angle to look at the data as a whole is to check when those shots are taken. An NBA has
                    four
                    quarters, and each quarter has 12 minutes. If the score is a draw at the end of 4 quarters, another
                    5
                    minutes
                    of overtime (OT) will be added to the game. The number of OTs can go on and on. Each time has no
                    more
                    than 24
                    seconds to run the attack as long as they still have possession of the ball. So, in general, the
                    distribution
                    should be uniform from the second 0 to 2880. But due to some tactical reasons, one team might hold
                    the
                    ball a
                    little longer than or shorter (like run-and-gun), so that&#39;s where the teams differ.</span></p>

                    it&#39;s
                    almost a 50-50 situation. Plain and simple.</span></p>

                    of
                    a document-term matrix. The more blue the dot is, the more positively correlated the two terms are,

            <h2><span>In the end</span></h2>
            <p><span>To conclude, the plots drawn in this part of the portfolio are rather sketchy. Nonetheless, they
                    still
                    managed to keep some formality, as the plotting style. Are there any brilliant observations emerging
                    from the
                    data? Maybe not. Still, this is just a preliminary step before modeling.</span></p>
