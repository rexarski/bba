            we are going</h1>

        <p><span>So here we are, at the end of the semester, a finished data science portfolio to some extent. In
                contrast, the original list of data science that we are genuinely interested in still remains
                unanswered. In
                this part of the portfolio, we will to take a look at the portfolio on a large scale and try to conclude
                the
                progress with what has been learned and what needs to be changed.</span></p>

        <section id="revisit">
            <h2>Revisit</h2>

            <p><span>The portfolio began with raising ten questions out of a topic of interest that we plan to take a
                    deep
                    dive into. The issue is that we were at a place where we had no information about how the upcoming
                    chapters
                    would pan out. For example, the original questions included analyzing how to quantify a team’s
                    offensive
                    system, while no actual part of this portfolio left the space to conduct, such an analysis. Most
                    parts
                    contained several restrictions such as fitting in three different models and visualizing the
                    results. So this
                    brings out the second point: what we have learned.</span></p>

        <section id="reality">
            <h2>Reality</h2>

            <p><span>Without a doubt, the portfolio serves well as a collection of showcasing various basic, both
                    supervised
                    and unsupervised, machine learning algorithms. Additionally, some experimental trials with
                    visualization
                    packages make the portfolio more vivid and interpretable. But even so, the whole procedure of how
                    each model
                    is built does not imitate the real-world machine learning or data science workflow. Each chapter is
                    more or
                    less like a showcase of what I can do with this sort of model, rather than sophisticatedly tuning
                    the model
                    towards a correct direction.</span></p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <p><span>So what’s next? For me, the completion of such a portfolio is never the end, as most of the
                    questions
                    remained unanswered. I am still eager to have my own idea about how modern basketball evolves,
                    craving a
                    better approach to apprehend today’s games. And hopefully, these will be the following topics I am
                    going to
                    address in my </span><a href='https://qrui.xyz'><span>blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
