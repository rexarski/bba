        <p><span>
                For this part of the portfolio, the goal is to take a look at the portfolio at a higher level and try to
                conclude
                the
                progress with what has been learned and what needs to be changed.</span>
        </p>

        <p><span>First start with some bads:</span></p>

        <p><span>The portfolio began with raising ten questions out of a topic of interest that we plan to take
                a
                deep
                dive into. The issue is that there was no information about how the upcoming
                chapters
                would pan out. For example, the original questions included analyzing how to quantify a team’s
                offensive
                system, while no actual part of this portfolio left the space to conduct, such an analysis. Most
                parts
                contained several restrictions such as fitting in three different models and visualizing the
                results. So this
                brings out the second point: what has been learned.</span></p>

        <p><span>Without a doubt, the portfolio serves well as a collection of showcasing various basic, both
                supervised
                and unsupervised, machine learning algorithms. Additionally, some experimental trials with
                visualization
                packages make the portfolio more vivid and interpretable. But even so, the whole procedure of
                how
                each model
                is built does not imitate the real-world machine learning or data science workflow. Each chapter
                is
                more or
                less like a showcase of what I can do with this sort of model, rather than sophisticatedly
                tuning
                the model
                towards a correct direction.</span></p>

        <p><span>Still, there are some highlights which are worth mentioning:</span></p>

        <ol>
            <li><span>The ambiguity of modern basketball players' positions was successfully captured in the clustering.
                    Players tend to be more versatile than their predecessors 20 years ago. (Although a comparison would
                    make this statement more sound.) Specifically, big players shoot more from perimeter, and tall
                    guards with defensive ability guarding multiple positions are favored. The versatility, for sure,
                    elevates the tactical possibilities.</span></li>
            <li><span>The play-by-play data indeed works well to train a predictive model. It's a pity the in-game
                    tracking now largely prefers result-based in-game events. That is to say, people care about if the
                    shot leads to scoring or not. That also means lots of details like pick-and-roll, covering, box-out,
                    hustle, etc. are omitted because they probably do not affect the team score directly. However, if
                    the in-game events can be imagined as a series of consequential but more general events, these
                    omitted details will play their parts. Back to the topic, the prediction based on a static in-game
                    scenario, which is the exact moment when the shot is taken, accurately reflects the fact if the shot
                    is made. Therefore, a team's analyst could provide some informative insights of their opponent teams
                    ahead of every game.</span></li>
            <li><span>The stats vary team by team, season by season. Even a player could evolve or recede in the span of
                    his career. All the probability calculation are conditional. That's also the beauty of modern
                    sports, everything is evolving all the time. By looking at a single player or a team, one can easily
                    tell the rises and falls through his playing stats. And what's always fascinating is that there are
                    always stories behind those numbers.</span></li>
        </ol>

        <p><span>So what’s next? The completion of such a portfolio is never the end, as most of the
                questions
                remained unanswered. Modern basketball has never ceased to evolve, and the data scientists
                should
                always being
                craving a
                better approach to apprehend today’s games. As the in-game tracking data becomes more and more detailed
                and accessible at the same time, the recap of tactics won't be limited to a two-dimensional tactic board
                any more. Moreover, data will be utilized to more aspects of running a professional basketball team such
                as team development, player scouting, even the ticket price setting and other operational decision
                making. In short, this is the best era of basketball analytics.</span></p>
