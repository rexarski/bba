        </h1>

        <section id="thoughts">
            <h2>Early thoughts</h2>

            <p>People have always shown interests in sports, data, and those simulation games putting both together.
                Behind
                the intensity, the competitiveness, the joy of triumph, data play an essential role in shaping the
                modern boundary of sports. Just like in other industries, data is used as reflections and predictions at
                the
                same time. What fascinates people the most is that data provide a new perspective to appreciate games.
                For
                example, there might be some memorable moments when talking about a particular player's career, but
                collectively, is our overall impression about a player accurate? We might find ourselves in a position
                close to ignorance.</p>
            <p>So in the portfolio, the topic selection is more like a loose collection of sports analytics
                applications. Because the data sources vary immensely, it is likely that no profound
                conclusions, like "how data would change the sports industry" or "what are the golden standards of being
                a
                basketball G.O.A.T. (the Greatest Of All Time)", will be drawn in the end. Instead, this is more or less
                like a showcase of what
                can be done when a fan stands at the crossroad of sports and data.

            <p>The sport of interest in this portfolio we be basketball because comparatively speaking,
                it has the most accessible open data.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="questions">
            <h2>An ever-updating roaster of questions</h2>

            <p>Ok, folks. Let's talk about the game plan.</p>

            <p>
                The
                coverage of these questions ranges from tactics, performance to some off-court factors like social
                network interactions, etc.
            </p>

            <p>Some rough plans about how to digest and answer these questions will be listed below as well.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q1">
            <h2>Q1 Expected points</h2>
            <p><b>How to quantify the expected points from one shot?</b></p>
            <p>Inspired by the expected goal metric in soccer,
                is it possible to apply that in basketball and make it more sensible than the shot percentage?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q2">
            <h2>Q2 Expected threats</h2>
            <p>Based on "expected points," <b>is it possible to quantify a player's offensive contribution with a
                    dynamic "expected
                    threat" concept?</b></p>
            <p>Or how to quantify such metric when the player is not taking the shot, a.k.a. playing off-ball?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q3">
            <h2>Q3 Clutch moment</h2>
            <p><b>When the clock is ticking, who is your most trustworthy ball handler, and who takes the last shot?</b>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="q4">
            <h2>Q4 Player interactions</h2>
            <p><b>How do players interact with each other off-court?</b></p>
            <p>Do teammates/ex-teammates interact the most?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q5">
            <h2>Q5 Social life vs. game plays</h2>
            <p><b>What's the relation (if any) between players' social media exposure and game performances?</b></p>
            <p>The more a player enjoys life, the worse he plays the next day or vice versa? This one is heavily
                influenced by an old Reddit post<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> illustrating James Harden's
                game night performances vs. the overall
                strip club rating of the city he plays against that night.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q6">
            <h2>Q6 Off-season topics</h2>
            <p><b>What are basketball fans' favorite topics in the off-season?</b></p>
            <p>Another social network-related question to raise.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q7">
            <h2>Q7 Myths of power ranking</h2>
            <p><b>How to present teams' power ranking to a casual sports fan?</b></p>
            <p>ELO is an incredible invention, but is it good enough?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q8">
            <h2>Q8 King of the off-season</h2>
            <p><b>Who's the king of the off-season?</b></p>
            <p>Another off-season secret. Some players choose to enjoy their lives, hanging out with friends, families;
                some go overseas for commercial reasons. But there can be only one king to rule it all.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q9">
            <h2>Q9 Sixth man</h2>
            <p><b>Sixth man, or a hidden blade?</b></p>
            <p>The league always favors the non-starter with the most ppg in a Sixth Man voting.
                It sounds like a "Best Bench Offensive Player Award" instead.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q10">
            <h2>Q10 Board man vs max contract</h2>
            <p><b>Board man gets paid? Is that true?</b></p>

            <p>It's a catchphrase from 2019 NBA champion Kawhi
                Leonard when he grabbed a rebound in a playoff game. But did all those rebounding leaders get paid in
                the reality?
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="q11">
            <h2>Q11 Taco Tuesday</h2>
            <p><b>Does Lebron James revitalize the term Taco Tuesday?</b></p>
            <p>The 36-year-old Los Angeles Laker star has been famous for sharing his weekly taco dinners on social
                media since 2019. But does that matter? Does the former cause the latter?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q12">
            <h2>Q12 Unlimited range</h2>
            <p><b>Who is the deadliest sniper?</b></p>
            <p>Let us go back to a genuine basketball question. It is no secret that who the best 3-pt shooter in
                the league is The real question is, who is the most accurate mad man from downtown? Dame Dollar? Chef
                Curry? Imagine
                if NBA introduces the rule of a
                4-point play. What's going to happen then?</p>
